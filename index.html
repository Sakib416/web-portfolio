         <h1>Dream Big</h1>
         <h3>What do you think?</h3>
         <p>When I see people around suffering form various diseases but  the treatment is costly and sometimes some diseases can't be identified , it's heart me a lot. So from my childhood I wanted to make a machine that can identify all kinds of diseases and also can guide us about the possible treatment. If I am successful, nobody is going to suffer from diseases anymore. Prey for me to fullfill my dream. </p>
